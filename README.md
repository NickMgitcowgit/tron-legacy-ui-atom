# Tron Legacy UI

UI theme based on Tron Legacy. Don't really know how this behaves without my Tron Legacy Syntax. I would recommend them together. They're a good couple.

More notes/updates to come! Thanks for checking it out!

Forked version >=6.1 includes Atom >=1.13 syntax updates as well as selected text highlighting fix.

Screenshot includes both my syntax and ui theme files
